Hi Dr. Resnik!

Attached is a Perl module (ShlomifConvCell.pm) I wrote to use your module to 
convert numbers in international notation. I also included two .pl scripts I 
used to invoke it.

I hereby license them under the MIT X11 license, which enables transfer of 
ownership and relicensing under any other license.

Regards,

        Shlomi Fish
