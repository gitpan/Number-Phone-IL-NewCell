BUGS
            This program was poorly tested !!!!

            As this is a run once program, I don't think that I will fix
            bugs or release new versions.

            There is no treatment for international prefix like
            +972-56-444222.

            IF YOU USE THIS PROGRAM, YOU DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK !!!.

            Make backup before you run this program !!!!
